    <h3>Dan Brown's Inferno</h3>
    <p>‘Seek and ye shall find.’
        With these words echoing in his head, <u>Harvard</u> symbologist <u>Robert Langdon</u> awakes in a hospital bed with no recollection of where he is or how he got there. Nor can he explain the origin of the <i>macabre</i> object that is found hidden in his belongings.
        A threat to his life will propel him and a <i>young</i> doctor, <u>Sienna Brooks</u>, into a breakneck chase across the city of <u>Florence</u>.</p>
